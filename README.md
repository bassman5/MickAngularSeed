## This is an AngularJS Application with testing and distribution build configured

[![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/bassman5/MickAngularSeed.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/bassman5/MickAngularSeed) [![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/bassman5/MickAngularSeed.svg?theme=shields.io)](https://david-dm.org/bassman5/MickAngularSeed) [![devDependency Status](https://david-dm.org/bassman5/MickAngularSeed/dev-status.svg?theme=shields.io)](https://david-dm.org/bassman5/MickAngularSeed#info=devDependencies)

Install
```
git clone https://github.com/bassman5/MickAngularSeed.git myapp
cd myapp
npm install 
```
Must have node and grunt globally installed first
Also protractor needs some setup see https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md
I have installed locally in the project rather than globally so after initial installation run
npm will install webdriver (following command)
```
./node_modules/.bin/webdriver-manager update
```

### Aims

* A seed project that incorporates AngularJS best practices
* Fully configured testing, both unit (with code coverage reports) and end-2-end
* Distribution build configured to combine, minify and timestamp js, css, and images
* File update watcher to run tests and auto re-load assets
* JShint checking all js files (reduced level for test files)
* Bower package management
* Yeoman.io scaffolding with html5boilerplate

#### Still to do
* DONE - Remove bower_components from the dist (but we do need sass-bootstrap/fonts) - you need to copy sass-bootstrap/fonts to /styles/fonts
* DONE - Add uncss grunt plugin to remove unused sccs selectors
* DONE - Add authentication, an auth service
* Add more examples of ui-router, something more app like for the main page
* Fix the yeoman scaffolding to generate the correct structure and test files

**Updated 27/Mar/14**
Now test and scss files co-located with source files

**Updated 3/May/14**
Added google analytics
Added login page with tests

**Updated 10/May/14**
Added Cucumber tests - to use grunt serve; grunt protractor:cucumber
Note that the home page is loaded at the start of the run and then navigateTo home page is done before each scenario
This is so that the page is only loaded once, don't use get in your tests unless you really need to.
Each Page (or page section) has a page object as described by [Selenium Page Objects](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects)

#### Best Practices
I have tried to follow the guides from Google at
[http://blog.angularjs.org/2014/02/an-angularjs-style-guide-and-best.html]

The style guide here
[https://github.com/mgechev/angularjs-style-guide]

JShint config is different for test files
grunt build (or serve:dist) will now package minified files (and uncss to minify css), images and fonts with cache busting ids

I have also not used multiple modules, just one module for all code.
As I don't expect this to be a massive app, minified code I believe is enough. Also module lazy loading is coming in Angular 2.0, will re-look at it then.
I expect this to change

Generate a changelog using [connvetional-changelog](https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog).

Uses git metadata, based on [these commit conventions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/).

If you have a problem on a mac with grunt serve hanging add the following line to /etc/launchd.conf and reboot
```
limit maxfiles 2048 10480
```
The default open files limit is very low on macosx.

### Fully configured testing
For unit testing, karma is configured with mocha. Mocha has much better async testing support (although version 2.0 is much better).

#### Build

It is important that we follow pagespeed guidelines.
```
grunt build
```
Create a 'dist' directory with minified js, css, images, & html.

```
grunt serve
```
Load the app in an http server, watch for changes, run sass, jshint, and karma unit tests with coverage reports
The coverage reports are generated in coverage/Chrome 33.0.1750 (Mac OS X 10.9.2)/index.html
Note the directory changes with Chrome version and machine OS version

```
grunt serve:dist
```
Create a 'dist' directory with minified js, css, images, & html and serve from an http server.
```
grunt karma:watch:start watch
```
for just the unit tests

```
grunt compass
```
Will generate css (this is done automatically in watch)


#### For e2e test (protractor / webdriver )

Start server (NOT NEEDED just run protractor)
```
./node_modules/.bin/webdriver-manager start
```

run tests with
```
grunt e2e
```
or
```
grunt e2e:dist
```
To run the e2e tests against a distribution build
Note this starts an express server (test/server) which has been generated from the express generator


#### Intellij Idea 13+ or Webstorm 7+
You can use the node.js plugin (seperate install) with '/usr/local/bin/grunt' as the JavaScript file and 'serve' as the Application Parameter
Also there is a great karma plugin (seperate install) Karam Node package is $(PROJECT_DIR)node-modules/karma and the Configuration file is test/karma-conf.js
To debug tests in WebStorm or Idea add a run configuration of Karma with the test/karma-conf.js file and you can run (with coverage)
or set breakpoints and debug in ide.

To debug protractor tests, add a run configuration with
```
Node Interpreter:       /usr/local/bin/node (or wherever node is installed)
JavaScript file:        node_modules/protractor/lib/cli.js
Application Parameters: test/protractor-cuke-conf.js
```

#### Deployment to s3

See https://github.com/jpillora/grunt-aws for options
```
grunt build s3
```

Will push the dist fold to an s3 bucket defined in the options section
```
        bucket: "angularseed",
```

If you then add to a Cloudfront distribution you get 98/100 from ySlow and Pagespeed looks good too!

This task expects a file called .aws-credentials.json in you project root but be careful not to add to source control, this file has been added to .gitignore

 * Create a `.aws-credentials.json` file like:

     ``` json
     {
       "accessKeyId": "...",
       "secretAccessKey": "..."
     }
     ```
